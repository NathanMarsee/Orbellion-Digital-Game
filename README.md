- Source code to all assets (including scripts and prefabs) are in the Main branch of this repository.
- Each branch, other than Main, was used as a way to store and test our code to ensure that this group was not making constant changes to the branch that contains the final, working bits of everyone's work.
- To build the software: 
  1. Clone the Main branch of the repository to your local system
  2. Download, install, and open Unity Hub (Note: This project was developed using Unity v2021.3.24f1, there may be some complications when trying to launch the project when using an older version of Unity).
  3. Select "Open" in Unity Hub and navigate to where you downloaded the cloned repo and select the repo's folder.
  4. Done

- Testing the project is just a matter of clicking on the play button and checking that there are no errors in the console window in Unity. Methods that are used in the scripts should already have their Game Objects assigned to them.
- If any new tests are added, such as new scripts and/or game objects, be sure to create a new branch for your tests. **THIS GROUP, AS A WHOLE, IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CHANGES MADE AFTER JUNE 9TH, 2023 SO DON'T BREAK ANYTHING IN MAIN!!!**
- If trying to build a release version of this project, ensure that all methods have their correct game objects assigned to them and are saved that way as a prefab. If not, changes made in your Unity scene may or may not be reflected to end users or others trying to access this software.
